<div class="nicehead"><span class="nice">Used software for this Blog</span></div>
This blog uses jekyll as blogging software to generate static html files from my sources:
> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator.
>  It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, 
> and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server.
Jekyll is written in ruby by the github co-founder Tom Preston-Werner. Find out more on the [jekyll homepage](http://www.jekyllrb.com).
