<div class="bighead">Used software for this Blog</div>
This blog uses jekyll as blogging software to generate static html files from my sources:
> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator.
>  It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, 
> and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server.
Jekyll is written in ruby by the github co-founder Tom Preston-Werner. Find out more on the [jekyll homepage](http://www.jekyllrb.com).

<div class="bighead">Other software I use here</div>
* [ArchLinux](http://www.archlinux.org/) as Operating System + zsh - to search and deal with my blog posts easily
* [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) for comments
* [nginx](http://nginx.org/) as lightweight webserver
* [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/) - Because of the great built in developer-tools
* [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - Because it's great for browsing the web :]
