So far I'm using [Zim](http://zim-wiki.org) as my note taking app of choice, I've already [written about it earlier]({site.url}/blog/software/zim-gutes-notiztool-desktop-wiki) (German post). Today I've found another promising alternative!</td>

In general, these are my requirements for a note taking app:
* Multi-Platform (min. Windows/Linux)
* clean and simple Interface
* fast startup and no useless extra-features, OneNote & comparable solutions are nothing for me
* easy file handling to be able to sync/backup e.g. with [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)
* flat files without database: reading of notes without the app itself should be possible
* if possible free and OpenSource of course :)

Today I found another alternative in [Cashys Blog](https://stadt-bremerhaven.de/notable-notiz-app-mit-markdown-unterstuetzung-fuer-windows-macos-und-linux/): [Notable](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/notable) is a pretty new project and was only some days ago published on Github. An advantage of Notable ist, is that  [Markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is used as markup language. I prefer Markdown syntax over Dokuwiki because I think it's better readable and wider used in various editors.

Other characteristics of Notable:
* embedding attachments and images is possible
* in contrast to Zim, no folder structure is supported, "only" tags can be set (including "special tags" to group notes in so called Notebooks). My experience is that the ordering in folders is not always helpful and therefore I think it's a good idea to use tags/search instead.
* notes can be marked as favourites and they can be pinned at the top

**Bottom line**: I'll surely keep an eye on [Notable](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/notable) in the near future. Currently there are still some bugs, e.g. search is not always working and produces an error/app crash. However, if the project gets constantly improved, it will probably replace Zim in the long run for me. Markdown is supported by a wider range of editors. I hope that it will be easier for me then to work with my notes on other systems, e.g. on my Android-Smartphone :).
